## Hi, I’m Panos 👋

Founder @ **Givelink** 🚀  
Building the future of giving through product, partnerships, and automation.

---

### 🚀 What I’m working on
- Scaling **Givelink** in the US 🇺🇸  
- Onboarding nonprofits fast, with zero friction  
- Closing supplier & fulfillment partnerships 🤝  
- Shipping fast, driven by real user feedback  

---

### 🧠 What I focus on
- **Founder execution**: sales, BD, ops, product decisions  
- **Systems thinking**: turning chaos into repeatable workflows  
- **Automation-first** ops (n8n, internal tools, dashboards) ⚙️  
- **AI in practice**: IRIS for recommendations & internal decision support 🤖  

I don’t speculate. I talk to users, ship, measure, iterate.

---

### 🛠️ How I build
- User interviews → product requirements  
- Fast pilots → real traction  
- Automation > headcount  
- Clarity > complexity  

Bias toward action. Always.

---

### 📌 Current priorities
- US nonprofit density  
- Supplier partnerships  
- Donor experience that converts 💳  
- Radical transparency (proof, tracking, verification) ✅
